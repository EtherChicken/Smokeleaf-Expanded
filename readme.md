  Huge thanks to the entire RimWorld modding community for helping me with any issues I faced.

  Smokeleaf Expanded is a mod which, well, expands on Smokeleaf. This mod adds multiple new drugs, buildings, items and even weapons! This mod is currently under development but is still in a playable state, any feedback/bug reports are much appreciated!
