Huge thanks to the entire RimWorld modding community for helping me with any issues I faced.

Smokeleaf Expanded is a mod which, well, expands on Smokeleaf. This mod adds multiple new drugs, buildings, items and even weapons! This mod is currently under development but is still in a playable state, any feedback/bug reports are much appreciated!

[h1]Important Note[h1]
This mod was made with Vanilla Brewing Expanded in mind, and as such a few items are only enabled when VBE is enabled, these are:
[list]
  [*]Blunt
  [*]Smokeleaf Soda*
[/list]

[h1]Current Features[/h1]

* = Without VBE the recipe does not use VBE's soda and in turn is only made with smokeleaf Oil
** = Needs Vanilla Brewing Expanded
