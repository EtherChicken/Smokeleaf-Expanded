Huge thanks to Aelanna#0001 for helping me with my questions, the multiple things would not be in this mod without her
Another thanks to the entire Vanilla Expanded team, not only does this mod require VEF to run but I was able to look at the XML files and Assemblies (mostly in VBE) and go from there to help create my mod
