Huge thanks to the entire RimWorld modding community for helping me with any issues I faced.

Smokeleaf Expanded is a mod which, well, expands on Smokeleaf. This mod adds multiple new drugs, buildings, items and even weapons! This mod is currently under development but is still in a playable state, any feedback/bug reports are much appreciated!

# Important Note
This mod was made with Vanilla Brewing Expanded in mind, and as such a few items are only enabled when VBE is enabled, these are:
Blunt
Smokeleaf Soda*

# Current Features
1. Resources
      * Cooked Smokeleaf
      * Smokeleaf Oil
2. Drugs
      * Edibles
      * Smokeleaf Soda*
      * Blunts**
3. Weapons
      * Smokeleaf Grenade
4. Buildings

      * Smokeleaf Spa (WIP)

* = Without VBE the recipe does not use VBE's soda and in turn is only made with smokeleaf Oil
** = Needs Vanilla Brewing Expanded
